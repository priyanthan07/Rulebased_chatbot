# Rulebased_chatbot
This is the basic level of chatbot implementation with the help of YouTube tutorials.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Discription
In this project, the chatbot is used to interact with an alien if it wants to contact people. This will have some predefined results which will be generated when appropriate input is given by the user. If the user provides inputs apart from this then the chatbot cannot answer that question. Because this is not a self-learning chatbot.
